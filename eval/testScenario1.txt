• adding commands to completely simulate special offer and its notification

This scenario requires you to manage explicitly time advancement (day
change with a dedicated Thread ?)

####
		
A test-scenario file contains a number of CLUI commands whose execution allows for re-
producing a given test scenario, typically setting up a given configuration of the myFoodora
system (i.e. creation of some resraurants, each with its one menu and meals offers, cre-
ation of some customers, as well as some courriers, simulation of some usage of the system
with creation of orders by customers and delivery of orders, calculation of profits for my-
Foodora, etc.). You may include several test-scenario files (e.g. testScenario1.txt,
testScenario2.txt, ...). For each test-scenario file you provide us with you MUST in-
clude a description of its content (what does it test?) in the report. We are going to run
each test-scenario file through the runtest command of the CLUI (see CLUI commands
above):
runtest testScenario1.txt
The mandatory testScenario1.txt must test each and every command of the CLUI
(except obviously runtest). Furthermore it should develop a meaningful scenario like that
depicted in the following example:
• logon as manager
• adding commands to show/print all items (user, meals, ...) in the initial
configuration
• register a few restaurants to the system
• register a few customers
• register a few couriers
• display the list of restaurant
• display the list of customers
• logout manager
• logon as restaurant (for each new restaurant)
• add (and populate) a menu to each restaurant (this requires login as restaurant
manager)
• add (half and/or full) meal to each restaurant’s menu, setting some special-offer and
meal-of-the-week meal deal
• display the menu of each restaurant
• logout restaurant
• logon as customer (for few customers)
• simulate placing of a few orders by few customers (concerning a few restaurants)
• logout

• logon as manager
• compute/display the total profit of the system (since creation and over a given time-
interval)
• change the profit policy of the system and re-compute the total profit of the system
(since creation and over the same time-interval as before)
• display the list of courriers sorted according to their operativity (num. of completed
delivery)
• adding commands to completely simulate special offer and its notification
for:
– meal of the day/week
– birthday celebration
